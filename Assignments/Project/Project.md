# Project Proposal: BMI Index and Obesity

## Background

Overweight is a big health problem that can cause many other health issues both among adults and children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC), weight that is higher than what is considered as a healthy weight for a given height is described as overweight or obese. Body Mass Index, or BMI, is used as a screening tool for overweight or obesity. The BMI index is defined as follows:

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. 

The range of BMI is divided into the following 4 major categories:

  1. If your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the underweight range.
  2. If your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the normal.
  3. If your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the overweight range.
  4. If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obese range.

Obesity itself is divided into the following subcategories:


  * Class 1: BMI of 30 to < 35
  * Class 2: BMI of 35 to < 40
  * Class 3: BMI of 40 or higher. Class 3 obesity is sometimes categorized as “extreme” or “severe” obesity.
