# Project Proposal: BMI Index and Obesity

## Background

Overweight is a big health problem that can cause many other health issues both among adults and children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC), weight that is higher than what is considered as a healthy weight for a given height is described as overweight or obese. Body Mass Index, or BMI, is used as a screening tool for overweight or obesity. The BMI index is defined as follows:

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. 

The range of BMI is divided into the following 4 major categories:

  1. If your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the underweight range.
  2. If your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the normal.
  3. If your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the overweight range.
  4. If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obese range.

Obesity itself is divided into the following subcategories:


  * Class 1: BMI of 30 to < 35
  * Class 2: BMI of 35 to < 40
  * Class 3: BMI of 40 or higher. Class 3 obesity is sometimes categorized as “extreme” or “severe” obesity.
  
  As Obesity is the root of many other diseases and health problem, it is very crucial to have a quantitative understanding of its status in U.S. and in the world. According to National Institute of Health (NIH), awareness of the importance of obesity and an urgency for action in view of the increasing numbers of people of excess weight at all ages is increasing. The focus is on the effect of obesity on conditions with high morbidity and mortality—for example, coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, type 2 diabetes and cancers,1 whereas the effect on osteoarthritis, back pain and other musculoskeletal problems2 is underappreciated.
  
In this project, we will study the status of obesity in U.S. and compare it with the obesity condition in other countries.

## Goal of the Project

In this project, we will attempt to answer the following questions:

 * What is the latest status of obesity in U.S. among men and women? We will explore the this question by measuring the mean BMI among men and women separately.
 * How has obesity (measured by the mean BMI) evolved during the past three decades in U.S. among men and women?
 * Is there a statistically meaningful difference between the BMI of men and women in U.S.?
 * What is the latest prevalence rate of obesity (*i.e.* proportion of persons in a population who are obese) in U.S. among men and women?
 * How has the prevalence rate of obesity evolved during the past three decades in U.S. among men and women? 
 * What is the latest prevalence rate of underweight (*i.e.* proportion of persons in a population who are underweight) in U.S. among men and women?
 * How has the prevalence rate of underweight evolved during the past three decades in U.S. among men and women?
 * How is the situation in other industrialized countries? We will try to answer all the above questions for some of the industrialized countries and find the relative situation of U.S. among the industrialized countries.
 
## Data Source

We will be mainly using the dataset of NCD.RisC (http://ncdrisc.org/index.html) which is freely available. We may also use a small dataset provided by Kaggle where the BMI of 500 individuals have been studied. We may use this small dataset as a sample, and try to do some inferential statistics. By studying this sample, we might be able to formulate some relevant questions about the population, and try to answer them using the Hypothesis Test.

## Data Characteristics

* The unit of our analysis is country. The unit for the sample (if we will study it) is person.
* The variables used in our analysis are **Country**, **Year**, **Gender**, **Mean BMI**, **Prevalence of BMI** (for different subclasses).
* In our exploratory analysis, we will use bar charts, summary statistics, scatter plots, and perhaps the hypothesis test.
